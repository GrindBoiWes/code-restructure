# Code Restructure
A resturcture and condensing of HTML and CSS code.


# Description
For the HTML section of this code, I went and and labeled everything correctly using the proper Semantics. You will see that the code is set up by Header, Main, Section, Aside, Footer. The images throughout have also been set with an alt for screen readers.

For the CSS section of this code, I condensed sections that have multiple repeating lines of code. Each section that was consolidated, had at least two extra sets of repeating code that wasn't required for the code to run properly. The structure of the code however, has remained the same.
